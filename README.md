# HashVault

HashVault enables any person to create their own encrypted file storage management system that posts a hash of any file to the public Ethereum blockchain to act as a verifiable timestamp of creation and ownership without revealing any information about the file to the public. 

This may be helpful for those looking to create a tamperproof and verifable trail of files. Use cases may involve proving first ownership and creation of trademarks, copyrighted materials, and patents. Moreso, individuals can leverage this project on machine learning data sets to prove editing history and legitimacy of files. Many other use cases are also possible, specifically any scenario in which someone may need to prove a timestamp, ownership, or editing history without specifically wanting to reveal this information to the public. 

Please see steps below for setting up your own HashVault:
