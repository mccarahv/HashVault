Creating clear and structured documentation for each file in your project, along with step-by-step deployment instructions, is essential for enabling users to understand and effectively utilize your software. Here's a template you can adapt to fit the specific files and structure of your HashVault project:

---

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need to set up the following:

1. **Infura Account:**
   - Sign up at [Infura.io](https://infura.io/) and create a new project to get an API key. This key will allow you to connect to Ethereum networks without running a full node.
   - Note your project ID, as you will need to include this in your application configuration.

2. **Etherscan API Key:**
   - Register at [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/) and generate an API key. This key is used to query transaction details and other blockchain data.
   - You will need this key to verify transaction statuses and retrieve timestamps.

3. **Ethereum Wallet:**
   - Generate an Ethereum wallet address and private key. You can use tools like [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) or [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).
   - Ensure your wallet has some Ethereum for deploying contracts and making transactions. For testnet deployment, you can get free Ether from a faucet.
